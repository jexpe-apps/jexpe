Jexpe is a free, open source SSH and SFTP client that makes connecting to your remote servers easy.

## Getting Started

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) as package manager, so follow his installation steps too.

```console

# Install all the dependencies listed within package.json
yarn install

# To be sure of using basic linting and formatting rules, subscribe to git-hooks
yarn prepare

# You are ready to start the development environment
yarn tauri dev
```
