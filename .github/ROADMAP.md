# 🗺️ JEXPE ROADMAP 🗺️

This roadmap should give direction on what to expect in the next few days, weeks as we continue to build together with the community.

Goal status:  
[ ✅ ] = achieved  
[ ❌ ] = not achieved  
[ ⛳ ] = planned

_Please note that this is not the final roadmap and what you see can be updated down the road, so check back regularly for any future updates._

## 🗿**Q3 2022**

[ ✅ ] **- THE IDEA WAS BORN**

> While me and @mghizzo were working for Minecraft servers, we realized that we were having some troubles finding a special SSH and SFTP client. We needed a single software including them both with additional features like passwords management and sharing.

**[ ✅ ] - MARKET ANALYSIS**

> Once the idea was born, we looked for competitors to see if there was a viable market. We found a few and analyzed and grouped them according to two parameters: all-in-one and cross-platform. We got:
>
> -   Putty ([https://www.putty.org/](https://www.putty.org/ 'https://www.putty.org/'))
> -   FileZilla ([https://filezilla-project.org/](https://filezilla-project.org/ 'https://filezilla-project.org/'))
> -   WinSCP ([https://winscp.net/](https://winscp.net/ 'https://winscp.net/'))
> -   CyberDuck ([https://cyberduck.io/](https://cyberduck.io/ 'https://cyberduck.io/'))
> -   MobaXterm ([https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ 'https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/'))
> -   WindTerm ([https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm 'https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm'))
> -   Termius ([https://termius.com/](https://termius.com/ 'https://termius.com/'))
>
> You'll probably think that we are a Termius copycat and that's
> partially true. Analyzing Termius' user base, we can deduce that
> almost 60% of all the users know it and use it on mobile. We are
> extremely focused on desktop instead.
>
> **Here is why Jexpe is better:**
>
> -   **It's lightweight**: Jexpe runs on Tauri which completely overcome Termius' stack (Electron) in terms of security and
>     performance.
> -   **It's open source**: We strongly believe that in 21st century a software like this should be free

**[ ✅ ] - SOFTWARE STACK**

> If you work like a developer today you will discover a trouble: there's not a software using a technology that provides you a tidy modern interface and a good performance without compromising. That's why we chose Tauri. It give us the chance to provide to our users all the features that I listed before.

**[ ✅ ] - LAUNCH THE PROJECT**

> We created a Github repository and a Discord server to grow up a community and a relationship between users and developers. Our goal is to not stop users' ideas with some feedbacks, but we want them to contribute directly to the project to grow blazingly fast.

## **Q1 2023**

**[ ⛳ ] - WORKING LOCAL SHELL**

> Let's start with basic functionality. The user must have the ability to:
> 
> -   Choose which of the shells available on his or her operating system to start.
> -   Have multiple shells open at the same time
> -   Manage through a horizontal navigation bar similar to Chrome's, all open shells

**[ ⛳ ] - 50 STARS ON GITHUB**

> Stars on GitHub are one of the most important metrics to watch for in this project. They reflect the interest of a segment of our community. The one composed of users who are also developers and therefore make a greater contribution to the project.

**[ ⛳ ] - 50 MEMBERS ON DISCORD**

> Members on the Discord server are another of the most important metrics to consider in this project. Our goal is to not stop users' ideas with some feedbacks, but we want them to contribute directly to the project to grow blazingly fast.
